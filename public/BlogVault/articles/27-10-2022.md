So i've built some basic beach button 

![[Pasted image 20221027224631.png]]

Animating my box shadow - i remember reading about a performance friendly version of how to implement animation of box shadow - found what looks to be a simple example of this here:
https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/how-to-animate-box-shadow/

![[Animation.gif]]

### TLDR - stops redraws of the page so performance go zoom
Set the `box-shadow` on your elements - in this case psuedo elements `::before` ` + ::after`
Animate the `opacity` - rather than the `box-shadow`

Was going to implement a gulp task to compile .less as it's what my work do so i installed gulp and did some of the basic stuff here like copying a file 
https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/getting-started-with-gulp-js/

In your project folder create a file named `to_copy.txt` , and a folder named `dist`. Let’s go into our Gulpfile and create a new task named `copy`.

``` JS GULPCOMMAND
const gulp = require('gulp');
  gulp.task('default', function  {
    return gulp.src('file.txt')
        .pipe( gulp.dest('dist') );
});
```

__BUT__ I figure may as well take this opportunity to take a look at sass as well soo

Installed https://sass-lang.com/guide instead

Used this to setup our watch for any changes to our CSS inside the /scss/ folder specifically input.scss and output to our /dist/ folder specifically our output.css file

```
sass --watch scss/input.scss dist/output.css
```
