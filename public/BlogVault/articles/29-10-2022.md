So i've hit the part of portfolio development where I feel I need a logo - quite often the sticking part as I feel like a logo feeds very heavily into the 'vibe' - am i too old to use this world? `vibe check` __who cares__, of the overall branding.

Time for some illustrator, I don't enjoy how inconsistent illustrator is with photoshop but alas, I despise dealing with logos in jpg form so here we goo.

You can see I progress from spelling my name to creating a J shape with a Y and then finding a nice J looking shape.

I took this further until a point I thought 'this is nice', I've managed to make a bird looking thing with my J which i'm so nicely named `Jay bird`.

__Until__ my partner kindly pointed out it looked more like a seal - she raised a good point.
Clearly I was too close to this and had some bias. Onto the next idea

I remembered I have glasses - time to make all the glasses sillhouetes - sill hanging onto this J shape - oh look I can make someone that looks like me out of the J's long hair too

More things - lets make the pointy out bits for the glasses so it doesn't look like lenses

I've fleshed out the whole glasses sillhouetes now lets test the glasses with funky eyes - oo I could make the eyes follow the cursor on my website - it's decided the logo has to have eyes.

I'll come back to look at these in a few days - don't want another seal incident.
