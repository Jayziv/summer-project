**Investigate GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) - seems very powerful, come across before but jogged my memory when a job specification desired exposure to this technology - loving animation worth a looksie

**Build portfolio designed**

**Update enrichment media analytics**

**Investigate different way of implementing a contact form** - https://www.mailgun.com/

**Explore normal mapping** of an object in web form seen - https://www.instagram.com/aristidebenoist/
 - Rendering a normal map
 - Lighting on a normal map (maybe based on cursor position)
 - Altering of a normal map based on interaction (possibly click - similar to how a melee hit in overwatch might warp the normal map of a surface texture to make it appear like damage has been done to that object)
