## UMBRACO .NET CMS

We use an older version(8?) of umbraco at work and I need to get to grips with it as our team+lead+dev has left and was the only person truely familiar with it.

Here's the journey :)

I don't have 9 grand kicking about so naturally we'll be going with Umbraco FREE

We're recommended to install Umbraco with .NET CLI
https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Fundamentals/Setup/Install/install-umbraco-with-templates
Turns out we need ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle ?
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-6.0.10-windows-hosting-bundle-installer

1.  Install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2.  Run `dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates` to install the project templates.

IIS is not enabled on this machine - as anticipated nothing works as easily as advertised :)

IIS Enabled - Time to restart

Back to https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Fundamentals/Setup/Install/install-umbraco-with-templates

1.  Install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2.  Run `dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates` to install the project templates.

## Run Umbraco

1.  Navigate to the newly created project folder:  
    `cd MyCustomUmbracoProject`
2.  Build and run the new Umbraco .Net Core project:  
    `dotnet build`  
    `dotnet run`

We have a working umbraco installation

Installed a basic theme to get started
`` dotnet add package Umbraco.TheStarterKit
