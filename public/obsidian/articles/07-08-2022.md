## Some success? working thumbnails, content images are no

Created a hacky way of getting the main image working for thumbnail that can be seen on this post,

Need to figure out a way to get markdown converted safely including HTML - markdown-it seems to have that functionality but uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML , fine for my things but not good practice.

Need to look at react-markdown more in-depth and figure out if I can do what I have already done using that.
