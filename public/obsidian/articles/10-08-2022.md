## Styling
Added some responsive styling to header and blog list pages so it actually works

## todo
Need to be able to test that the site still works after a new article works, perhaps a 
script to run before push? check things work - jest 

sort blog articles most recent to oldest - ***seem to have fixed this by reversing order of .map for the posts***

less/sass ? need to set proper @ style variables, maybe doable in 

Need to componentise elements, look at props etc and atomic component methodology better

integrate markdown-it-container
